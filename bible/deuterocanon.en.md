# Commentary on the Deuterocanon

The Deuterocanon refers to a collection of books and additions to books that are included in the Old Testament of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles but are not found in the Hebrew Bible or most Protestant Bibles. Here's a detailed explanation:

#### Definition and Meaning
- **Deuterocanonical**: The term "Deuterocanonical" means "second canon." It is used to describe books that are considered canonical by some Christian traditions but are not part of the Hebrew Bible. These books are included in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, and are accepted by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches as part of the biblical canon.

#### Historical Context
- **Intertestamental Period**: The Deuterocanonical books were written during the intertestamental period, which is the time between the Old and New Testaments. This period is also known as the "400 years of silence" because it is believed that there were no prophetic writings during this time.
- **Cultural Influence**: During this period, the Jewish people were under the influence of Hellenistic culture, which is reflected in the language and themes of the Deuterocanonical books. The books were originally written in Greek, which was the lingua franca of the time due to the conquests of Alexander the Great.

#### List of Deuterocanonical Books
The Deuterocanonical books include:
- Tobit
- Judith
- Baruch
- Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)
- Wisdom
- 1 Maccabees
- 2 Maccabees
- Additions to Esther
- Additions to Daniel (including the stories of Susanna, Bel and the Dragon)
- 1 Esdras
- 2 Esdras
- Prayer of Manasseh
- 3 Maccabees
- 4 Maccabees
- Psalm 151 (accepted by the Eastern Orthodox Church).

#### Canonical Status
- **Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches**: These churches consider the Deuterocanonical books to be divinely inspired and include them in their canon. The Roman Catholic Church affirmed their status at the Council of Trent in 1546.
- **Protestant Churches**: Most Protestant denominations do not consider these books to be divinely inspired and refer to them as the Apocrypha. They may be included in some Protestant Bibles as a separate section for historical and educational purposes.

#### Importance and Influence
- **Theological and Historical Insight**: The Deuterocanonical books provide valuable historical and theological insights into Jewish life and thought during the intertestamental period. They include narratives, wisdom literature, and additions to canonical books that enrich the understanding of Jewish history and beliefs.
- **Controversial Doctrines**: Some doctrines, such as purgatory and indulgences, find support in the Deuterocanonical books, particularly in 2 Maccabees. This has been a point of contention between different Christian traditions.

In summary, the Deuterocanonical books are an important part of the biblical canon for certain Christian traditions, offering historical, cultural, and theological insights. Their acceptance varies among different Christian denominations, reflecting broader differences in biblical interpretation and tradition.

## Tobit

The Book of Tobit is a deuterocanonical book, meaning it is included in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles but not in the Jewish or Protestant canons. It is considered part of the Apocrypha in Protestant traditions. The book is a narrative that combines elements of folklore, wisdom literature, and religious teachings, and it is often regarded as a work of fiction with historical references.

#### Summary of the Story

- **Setting and Characters**: The story is set in the 8th century BC, although it was likely written between 225 and 175 BC. It revolves around two Israelite families: Tobit's family in Nineveh and Sarah's family in Ecbatana.
- **Plot**: Tobit, a devout and righteous man from the tribe of Naphtali, is living in Nineveh after being deported by the Assyrians. Despite his piety, he becomes blind due to an accident involving bird droppings. Meanwhile, Sarah, a relative living in Ecbatana, is plagued by a demon named Asmodeus, who kills her suitors on their wedding nights.
- **Divine Intervention**: Both Tobit and Sarah pray for death due to their misfortunes. God hears their prayers and sends the archangel Raphael to assist them. Tobit's son, Tobias, is sent to retrieve money from a relative, and Raphael, disguised as a human, accompanies him.
- **Resolution**: During their journey, Raphael instructs Tobias to catch a fish, whose heart and liver can exorcise demons, and whose gall can cure blindness. Tobias uses these to drive out the demon Asmodeus and marries Sarah. They return to Nineveh, where Tobias uses the fish's gall to cure Tobit's blindness. Raphael reveals his true identity and departs, leaving the family to praise God.

#### Themes and Significance

- **Faith and Providence**: The book emphasizes themes of faith, divine providence, and the importance of prayer and righteousness. It illustrates how God tests the faithful, responds to prayers, and protects His covenant community.
- **Moral and Ethical Teachings**: Tobit includes teachings on the intercession of angels, filial piety, tithing, almsgiving, and reverence for the dead. It is often read during weddings due to its praise for the purity of marriage.

#### Canonical Status and Influence

- **Canonical Status**: The Book of Tobit is recognized as canonical by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches but is considered apocryphal by Protestant traditions. It was affirmed as part of the Old Testament Canon by several early councils and church figures.
- **Cultural Influence**: The story of Tobit has influenced theology, art, and culture, particularly in Europe. It has been depicted in various artworks and inspired musical compositions, such as Joseph Haydn's oratorio "Il ritorno di Tobia".

#### Conclusion

The Book of Tobit is a rich narrative that blends religious teachings with elements of adventure and romance. It serves as a guide for maintaining faith and identity during times of trial and is valued for its moral and ethical lessons. Despite its non-canonical status in some traditions, it remains an important work for its spiritual and cultural contributions.
