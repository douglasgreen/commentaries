> 17. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one’s plans.

In this passage, Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability in military
strategy. He advises generals to not only follow his counsel but also to take advantage of favorable
circumstances that may arise beyond the ordinary rules of warfare.

1. **Heeding Counsel and Seizing Opportunities**: Sun Tzu suggests that while it is important to
   follow strategic principles and guidelines, generals should also be alert to any advantageous
   situations that present themselves. These opportunities may not be covered by standard rules but
   can provide significant benefits if recognized and exploited.

2. **Modifying Plans According to Circumstances**: Sun Tzu stresses the need for adaptability in
   strategy. As circumstances change, so too should the plans and tactics of a military leader. This
   flexibility allows a general to respond effectively to dynamic situations and to capitalize on
   unexpected opportunities.

### Deception in Warfare

> 18. All warfare is based on deception.
> 19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive;
>     when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make
>     him believe we are near.
> 20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.
> 21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.
> 22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may
>     grow arrogant.
> 23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.
> 24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
> 25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.

In this passage, Sun Tzu elaborates on the principle that deception is a fundamental aspect of
warfare. He provides various strategies for using deception to gain an advantage over the enemy.

1. **Deception as a Foundation**: Sun Tzu begins by stating that all warfare is based on deception.
   This means that misleading the enemy about your true intentions, capabilities, and positions is
   crucial for gaining a strategic advantage.

2. **Creating False Impressions**: Sun Tzu advises creating false impressions to confuse and mislead
   the enemy. For example, when you are ready to attack, you should appear unable; when you are
   using your forces, you should seem inactive; when you are near, make the enemy believe you are
   far away, and vice versa. These tactics keep the enemy uncertain and off-balance.

3. **Enticing and Crushing the Enemy**: By holding out baits, you can lure the enemy into making
   mistakes. Feigning disorder can make the enemy overconfident, allowing you to strike decisively
   when they are vulnerable.

4. **Adapting to the Enemy's Strengths and Weaknesses**: Sun Tzu suggests adapting your strategy
   based on the enemy's condition. If the enemy is secure, be prepared; if they are stronger, evade
   them. If the enemy is easily angered, provoke them to make rash decisions. Pretending to be weak
   can make the enemy overconfident and careless.

5. **Exploiting Enemy Weaknesses**: Attack the enemy where they are unprepared and appear where you
   are not expected. This element of surprise can lead to significant advantages and disrupt the
   enemy's plans.

6. **Secrecy of Strategies**: Sun Tzu emphasizes that these deceptive strategies, which lead to
   victory, should not be revealed beforehand. Keeping plans secret ensures that the enemy cannot
   anticipate or counter them.

#### Key Points to Consider

- **Strategic Deception**: Deception is a powerful tool in warfare, allowing you to manipulate the
  enemy's perceptions and actions to your advantage.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The ability to adapt your strategies based on the enemy's
  strengths, weaknesses, and temperament is crucial for success.
- **Element of Surprise**: Surprise attacks and unexpected maneuvers can disrupt the enemy's plans
  and create opportunities for victory.

significant advantage over the enemy. This approach highlights the need for strategic deception,
adaptability, and surprise in the art of war.

### Calculations Before Battle

> 26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is
>     fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many
>     calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at
>     all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

In this passage, Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of thorough preparation and strategic planning
before engaging in battle. He contrasts the outcomes of generals who make extensive calculations
with those who do not.

1. **Importance of Calculations**: Sun Tzu states that a general who wins a battle makes many
   calculations in advance. These calculations involve careful planning, analysis, and consideration
   of various factors that could influence the outcome of the battle. This preparation is often done
   in a dedicated space, referred to as a "temple," where the general can deliberate and strategize
   without distractions.

2. **Consequences of Inadequate Planning**: Conversely, a general who loses a battle tends to make
   few calculations beforehand. This lack of preparation leads to poor decision-making and increases
   the likelihood of defeat. Sun Tzu suggests that the more calculations and planning a general
   undertakes, the greater their chances of victory. Conversely, minimal or no calculations lead to
   failure.

3. **Predicting Outcomes**: Sun Tzu asserts that by observing the level of preparation and
   calculation a general undertakes, one can predict the likelihood of their success or failure.
   This highlights the critical role of strategic foresight and meticulous planning in achieving
   victory.

#### Key Points to Consider

- **Thorough Preparation**: The passage underscores the importance of thorough preparation and
  planning in warfare. A well-prepared general is more likely to anticipate challenges and devise

  planning. By considering all possible scenarios and factors, a general can make informed decisions
  that enhance their chances of success.

#### Summary

Sun Tzu's passage emphasizes the importance of extensive calculations and strategic planning in
warfare. A general who thoroughly prepares and considers various factors before battle is more
likely to achieve victory. This approach highlights the critical role of preparation, strategic
foresight, and attention to detail in the art of war.

## Chapter II. WAGING WAR

Chapter II of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War," titled "Waging War," focuses on the strategic and
logistical aspects of conducting warfare. Here are the key points and themes discussed in this
chapter:

1. **Efficiency and Speed**:

    - Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of conducting war efficiently and swiftly. Prolonged warfare
      is detrimental as it exhausts resources, dampens the morale of soldiers, and weakens the
      state.
    - A quick victory is crucial to minimize the financial and human costs of war. Delays can lead
      to exhaustion and provide opportunities for the enemy to exploit weaknesses.

2. **Resource Management**:

    - The chapter highlights the significant costs associated with maintaining an army, including
      provisions, equipment, and logistics. Sun Tzu advises against raising a second levy or
      overloading supply wagons.
    - Foraging on enemy territory is recommended to sustain the army, as resources taken from the
      enemy are more valuable than those brought from home.

3. **Avoiding Prolonged Conflict**:

    - Sun Tzu argues that no country has ever benefited from prolonged warfare. The strain on
      resources and the population can lead to poverty and discontent.
    - The goal of war should be victory, not glory or lengthy campaigns. A wise leader focuses on
      achieving a decisive victory to ensure peace and stability.

4. **Leadership and Morale**:

    - Effective leadership involves motivating troops and rewarding them for their achievements.
      Anger and rewards can be used to drive soldiers to fight effectively.
