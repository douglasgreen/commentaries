> 17. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one’s plans.

In this passage, Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability in military
strategy. He advises generals to not only follow his counsel but also to take advantage of favorable
circumstances that may arise beyond the ordinary rules of warfare.

1. **Heeding Counsel and Seizing Opportunities**: Sun Tzu suggests that while it is important to
   follow strategic principles and guidelines, generals should also be alert to any advantageous
   situations that present themselves. These opportunities may not be covered by standard rules but
   can provide significant benefits if recognized and exploited.

2. **Modifying Plans According to Circumstances**: Sun Tzu stresses the need for adaptability in
   strategy. As circumstances change, so too should the plans and tactics of a military leader. This
   flexibility allows a general to respond effectively to dynamic situations and to capitalize on
   unexpected opportunities.

### Deception in Warfare

> 18. All warfare is based on deception.
> 19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive;
>     when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make
>     him believe we are near.
> 20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.
> 21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.
> 22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may
>     grow arrogant.
> 23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.
> 24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
> 25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.

In this passage, Sun Tzu elaborates on the principle that deception is a fundamental aspect of
warfare. He provides various strategies for using deception to gain an advantage over the enemy.

1. **Deception as a Foundation**: Sun Tzu begins by stating that all warfare is based on deception.
   This means that misleading the enemy about your true intentions, capabilities, and positions is
   crucial for gaining a strategic advantage.

2. **Creating False Impressions**: Sun Tzu advises creating false impressions to confuse and mislead
   the enemy. For example, when you are ready to attack, you should appear unable; when you are
   using your forces, you should seem inactive; when you are near, make the enemy believe you are
   far away, and vice versa. These tactics keep the enemy uncertain and off-balance.

3. **Enticing and Crushing the Enemy**: By holding out baits, you can lure the enemy into making
   mistakes. Feigning disorder can make the enemy overconfident, allowing you to strike decisively
   when they are vulnerable.

4. **Adapting to the Enemy's Strengths and Weaknesses**: Sun Tzu suggests adapting your strategy
   based on the enemy's condition. If the enemy is secure, be prepared; if they are stronger, evade
   them. If the enemy is easily angered, provoke them to make rash decisions. Pretending to be weak
   can make the enemy overconfident and careless.

5. **Exploiting Enemy Weaknesses**: Attack the enemy where they are unprepared and appear where you
   are not expected. This element of surprise can lead to significant advantages and disrupt the
   enemy's plans.

6. **Secrecy of Strategies**: Sun Tzu emphasizes that these deceptive strategies, which lead to
   victory, should not be revealed beforehand. Keeping plans secret ensures that the enemy cannot
   anticipate or counter them.

#### Key Points to Consider

- **Strategic Deception**: Deception is a powerful tool in warfare, allowing you to manipulate the
  enemy's perceptions and actions to your advantage.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The ability to adapt your strategies based on the enemy's
  strengths, weaknesses, and temperament is crucial for success.
- **Element of Surprise**: Surprise attacks and unexpected maneuvers can disrupt the enemy's plans
  and create opportunities for victory.
- **Secrecy and Security**: Maintaining the secrecy of your strategies is essential to prevent the
  enemy from countering your plans.

significant advantage over the enemy. This approach highlights the need for strategic deception,
adaptability, and surprise in the art of war.

### Calculations Before Battle

> 26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is
>     fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many
>     calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at
>     all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

In this passage, Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of thorough preparation and strategic planning
before engaging in battle. He contrasts the outcomes of generals who make extensive calculations
with those who do not.

1. **Importance of Calculations**: Sun Tzu states that a general who wins a battle makes many
   calculations in advance. These calculations involve careful planning, analysis, and consideration
   of various factors that could influence the outcome of the battle. This preparation is often done
   in a dedicated space, referred to as a "temple," where the general can deliberate and strategize
   without distractions.

2. **Consequences of Inadequate Planning**: Conversely, a general who loses a battle tends to make
   few calculations beforehand. This lack of preparation leads to poor decision-making and increases
   the likelihood of defeat. Sun Tzu suggests that the more calculations and planning a general
   undertakes, the greater their chances of victory. Conversely, minimal or no calculations lead to
   failure.

3. **Predicting Outcomes**: Sun Tzu asserts that by observing the level of preparation and
   calculation a general undertakes, one can predict the likelihood of their success or failure.
   This highlights the critical role of strategic foresight and meticulous planning in achieving
   victory.

#### Key Points to Consider

- **Thorough Preparation**: The passage underscores the importance of thorough preparation and
  planning in warfare. A well-prepared general is more likely to anticipate challenges and devise

  planning. By considering all possible scenarios and factors, a general can make informed decisions
  that enhance their chances of success.

#### Summary

Sun Tzu's passage emphasizes the importance of extensive calculations and strategic planning in
warfare. A general who thoroughly prepares and considers various factors before battle is more
likely to achieve victory. This approach highlights the critical role of preparation, strategic
foresight, and attention to detail in the art of war.

## Chapter II: Waging War

Chapter II of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War," titled "Waging War," focuses on the strategic and
logistical aspects of conducting warfare. Here are the key points and themes discussed in this
chapter:

1. **Efficiency and Speed**:

    - Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of conducting war efficiently and swiftly. Prolonged warfare
      is detrimental as it exhausts resources, dampens the morale of soldiers, and weakens the
      state.
    - A quick victory is crucial to minimize the financial and human costs of war. Delays can lead
      to exhaustion and provide opportunities for the enemy to exploit weaknesses.

2. **Resource Management**:

    - The chapter highlights the significant costs associated with maintaining an army, including
      provisions, equipment, and logistics. Sun Tzu advises against raising a second levy or
      overloading supply wagons.
    - Foraging on enemy territory is recommended to sustain the army, as resources taken from the
      enemy are more valuable than those brought from home.

3. **Avoiding Prolonged Conflict**:

    - Sun Tzu argues that no country has ever benefited from prolonged warfare. The strain on
      resources and the population can lead to poverty and discontent.
    - The goal of war should be victory, not glory or lengthy campaigns. A wise leader focuses on
      achieving a decisive victory to ensure peace and stability.

4. **Leadership and Morale**:

    - Effective leadership involves motivating troops and rewarding them for their achievements.
      Anger and rewards can be used to drive soldiers to fight effectively.
    - Captured soldiers and equipment should be treated well and integrated into one's own forces to
      strengthen the army.

5. **Strategic Use of Resources**:

      capturing enemy provisions and equipment to reduce the burden on one's own state.

Overall, Chapter II of "The Art of War" underscores the importance of strategic planning, efficient
resource management, and swift execution in warfare. Sun Tzu's insights emphasize the need for
leaders to understand the costs and consequences of war to achieve victory effectively.

### The Cost of War

> 1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots,
>    as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to
>    carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of
>    guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armour, will reach
>    the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of
>    100,000 men.

This passage describes the logistical and financial considerations involved in waging war. Sun Tzu
emphasizes the substantial resources required to maintain a large army, highlighting the costs
associated with deploying 100,000 soldiers, along with chariots and provisions. The passage

### The Dangers of Prolonged Warfare

> 2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, the men’s weapons will grow
>    dull and their ardour will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your
>    strength.
> 3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the
>    strain.
> 4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength exhausted and your
>    treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no
>    man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.

In this passage, Sun Tzu warns about the dangers of prolonged warfare. He emphasizes the negative
consequences that can arise when a military campaign is extended over a long period.

#### Key Points to Consider

1. **Dulling of Weapons and Dampening of Ardor**: Sun Tzu notes that if victory takes too long to
   achieve, the soldiers' weapons will become dull, and their enthusiasm will wane. This
   metaphorically suggests that prolonged conflict can lead to a decrease in effectiveness and

strain on the home state, allowing for a more sustainable and efficient military campaign. This
strategic approach minimizes the economic and logistical impact of war, ensuring that the army
remains effective without overburdening the state's resources.

### Economic Impact on the State

> 10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a
>     distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.
> 11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the
>     people’s substance to be drained away.
> 12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.

In this passage, Sun Tzu discusses the economic impact of maintaining an army and the consequences
of poor resource management during warfare.

   it becomes necessary to support the army through contributions from distant regions. This can
   lead to logistical challenges and inefficiencies, as resources must be transported over long
   distances.

2. **Impoverishment of the People**: Supporting an army from afar places a financial burden on the
   people, leading to their impoverishment. This reflects the strain that prolonged military
   campaigns can place on a nation's economy and its citizens.

3. **Inflation and Economic Strain**: The presence of an army nearby can cause local prices to rise
   due to increased demand for goods and services. This inflationary pressure drains the resources
   of the local population, further exacerbating their economic hardship.

4. **Heavy Exactions on the Peasantry**: As the local population's resources are depleted, they may
   face heavy taxes or exactions to support the war effort. This can lead to social unrest and
   dissatisfaction among the populace, weakening the state's internal stability.

#### Summary

Sun Tzu's passage emphasizes the economic challenges associated with maintaining an army during
warfare. He warns that poor resource management can lead to the impoverishment of the people and
strain the state's finances. The presence of an army can drive up local prices, further draining the
resources of the population. To avoid these negative consequences, Sun Tzu advocates for efficient
resource management and strategic planning to minimize the economic impact of military campaigns.
This insight remains relevant today, highlighting the importance of balancing military needs with
economic sustainability.

### Consequences of Resource Drain

> 13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be
> stripped bare, and three-tenths of their incomes will be dissipated; while Government expenses for
> broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,
> protective mantlets, draught-oxen and heavy waggons, will amount to four-tenths of its total
> revenue.

In this passage, Sun Tzu highlights the economic consequences of war on both the state and its
people. He emphasizes the financial strain that prolonged military campaigns can impose, leading to
significant depletion of resources.

#### Key Points to Consider

1. **Loss of Substance and Exhaustion of Strength**: Sun Tzu points out that the continuous demands
   of war can strip the homes of the people bare, leading to a significant loss of their income.
   This reflects the heavy toll that war takes on the civilian population, as their resources are
   diverted to support the military effort.

   be dissipated due to the war. This indicates the substantial economic burden placed on
   individuals, which can lead to widespread poverty and hardship among the populace.

3. **Government Expenses**: Sun Tzu notes that the government's expenses for maintaining military
   equipment and resources—such as chariots, horses, armor, and other supplies—will consume
   four-tenths of its total revenue. This highlights the significant financial commitment required
   to sustain a prolonged military campaign.

4. **Economic Strain and Social Consequences**: The passage underscores the broader economic strain
   that war imposes on a nation. As resources are depleted, both the government and the people face
   financial challenges, which can lead to social unrest and weaken the state's stability.

costs associated with maintaining a military campaign, Sun Tzu underscores the importance of
efficient resource management and strategic planning to minimize the economic burden of war. This
insight remains relevant today, as it highlights the need to balance military objectives with
economic sustainability to ensure the long-term stability of a nation.

### Foraging as a Strategy

> 15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy’s
>     provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s own, and likewise a single picul of his provender
>     is equivalent to twenty from one’s own store.

In this passage, Sun Tzu emphasizes the strategic advantage of utilizing enemy resources during
warfare. He highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of foraging on the enemy to sustain an army.

#### Key Points to Consider

   the enemy. This means that instead of relying solely on supplies from home, the army should
   utilize the resources available in enemy territory. This strategy reduces the logistical burden
   on the home state and allows the army to sustain itself more effectively.

2. **Value of Enemy Provisions**: Sun Tzu states that one cartload of the enemy's provisions is
   equivalent to twenty of one's own. Similarly, a single picul (a unit of weight) of the enemy's
   provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store. This metaphorically illustrates the
   immense value and strategic advantage gained by using enemy resources, as it not only sustains
   the army but also weakens the enemy by depriving them of their supplies.

3. **Strategic Efficiency**: By foraging on the enemy, a general can maintain the army's strength
   and morale while minimizing the strain on the home state's resources. This approach allows for
   more efficient and sustainable military operations, reducing the need for long supply lines and
   the associated costs.

4. **Psychological and Tactical Impact**: Utilizing enemy resources can have a psychological impact
   on both the enemy and the army. It demoralizes the enemy by depleting their supplies and boosts
   the morale of the army by ensuring they are well-provisioned. This tactic also disrupts the
   enemy's logistics and weakens their ability to sustain their own forces.

   soldiers must be given rewards. This highlights the importance of incentives in maintaining
   morale and encouraging soldiers to perform their best. Rewards can take various forms, such as
   spoils of war or recognition for bravery.

3. **Motivation and Morale**: The passage underscores the significance of motivation and morale in
   military success. By rousing emotions and offering rewards, a general can inspire soldiers to
   fight more effectively and remain committed to the campaign's objectives.

4. **Strategic Use of Spoils**: Sun Tzu implies that the spoils captured from the enemy should be
   used as rewards for the soldiers. This not only motivates the troops but also ensures that the
   resources gained from victories are put to good use, further strengthening the army's position.

#### Summary

Sun Tzu's passage emphasizes the importance of psychological and motivational strategies in warfare.
By rousing soldiers' emotions and providing them with rewards, a general can enhance their combat
effectiveness and maintain high morale. This approach ensures that soldiers are motivated to fight
with determination and that the advantages gained from defeating the enemy are maximized. The
strategic use of incentives and emotional engagement remains a relevant concept in leadership and
management today, highlighting the importance of motivation in achieving success.

### Utilizing Captured Resources

> 17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be
>     rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and
>     the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly
>     treated and kept.
> 18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength.

In this passage, Sun Tzu discusses the strategic benefits of integrating captured enemy resources
and personnel into one's own forces. This approach not only strengthens the army but also maximizes
the advantages gained from victory.

## Chapter III: Attack by Stratagem

#### Key Concepts

1. **Preservation Over Destruction:**

    - Sun Tzu emphasizes that the best strategy in warfare is to capture the enemy's territory and
      forces intact rather than destroying them. This approach minimizes unnecessary destruction and
      preserves resources for future use.

2. **Supreme Excellence:**

    - True excellence in warfare is not about winning every battle but about breaking the enemy's
      resistance without fighting. This can be achieved through strategic planning and psychological
      tactics.

3. **Hierarchy of Strategies:**

    - The highest form of strategy is to thwart the enemy's plans. The next best is to prevent the
      enemy from forming alliances. Following that is to engage the enemy's army directly. The least
      desirable strategy is to besiege walled cities due to the high cost and effort involved.

4. **Avoiding Sieges:**

    - Sieges are costly and time-consuming, often resulting in significant casualties without
      guaranteeing success. Sun Tzu advises avoiding them unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Strategic Deployment:**

    - Sun Tzu provides guidelines on how to deploy forces based on their relative strength compared
      to the enemy. For example, if your forces are ten times the enemy's, surround them; if five
      times, attack; if twice as numerous, divide your forces.

6. **Role of the General:**

    - The general is crucial to the state's strength. A competent general ensures the army's
      effectiveness, while a flawed one weakens it. The general must be adaptable and not
      constrained by rigid rules.

7. **Five Essentials for Victory:**

    - Knowing when to fight and when not to.
    - Handling both superior and inferior forces effectively.
    - Ensuring unity and morale within the army.
    - Being prepared and taking the enemy by surprise.
    - Having autonomy and not being interfered with by the sovereign.

8. **Knowledge of Self and Enemy:**
    - Understanding both your own capabilities and those of the enemy is crucial. This knowledge
      allows for strategic planning and increases the likelihood of victory.

#### Summary

Chapter III of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" focuses on the importance of strategy over brute force. It
advocates for preserving resources and achieving victory with minimal conflict. The chapter outlines
a hierarchy of strategies, emphasizing the importance of understanding both one's own strengths and
the enemy's weaknesses. It also highlights the critical role of the general in ensuring the army's
success and the importance of strategic deployment based on the relative strength of forces.
Overall, the chapter underscores the value of strategic thinking and adaptability in warfare.

### The Art of War and Strategy

> 1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country
>    whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an
>    army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to
>    destroy them.
> 2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence
>    consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.

#### 1. Preservation Over Destruction

- Sun Tzu emphasizes that the most effective strategy in warfare is to capture the enemy's territory
  and forces intact rather than destroying them. This approach is beneficial because it preserves
  resources and minimizes unnecessary destruction, which can lead to long-term enmity and further
  conflicts.
- By capturing rather than destroying, you can use the enemy's resources and personnel to your
  advantage. This can also serve as a psychological tactic, demonstrating superiority without
  resorting to violence, which can demoralize the enemy and reduce their willingness to resist.

#### 2. Supreme Excellence

- Sun Tzu argues that true excellence in warfare is not about winning every battle through combat
  but about breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting. This can be achieved through strategic
  planning, deception, and psychological tactics that undermine the enemy's will to fight.
- Achieving victory without battle is considered the highest form of strategy because it conserves
  resources and minimizes casualties. It also positions the victor as morally superior, which can
  have long-term benefits in maintaining peace and stability.

#### Summary

In this passage, Sun Tzu highlights the importance of strategic thinking over brute force. The goal
is to achieve victory with minimal conflict by capturing the enemy's resources and breaking their
will to fight without engaging in battle. This approach not only conserves resources but also
establishes a position of moral and strategic superiority.

### Generalship and Tactical Approaches

> 3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy’s plans; the next best is to prevent
>    the junction of the enemy’s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the
>    field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
> 4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of
>    mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and
>    the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.

#### 3. Hierarchy of Strategies

- **Balking the Enemy's Plans:** The highest form of generalship is to thwart the enemy's plans
  before they can be executed. This involves understanding the enemy's strategies and countering
  them proactively. By doing so, you can prevent conflicts from escalating and maintain the upper
  hand without engaging in direct combat.
- **Preventing the Junction of Forces:** The next best strategy is to prevent the enemy from
  consolidating their forces. By isolating the enemy's units, you weaken their overall strength and
  reduce their ability to mount a coordinated attack. This can be achieved through strategic
  positioning and maneuvers that disrupt the enemy's plans to unite their forces.
- **Attacking in the Field:** If the first two strategies are not feasible, the next option is to
  engage the enemy's army in the field. This involves direct combat but is still preferable to a
  siege because it allows for more flexibility and less resource expenditure.
- **Avoiding Sieges:** The worst strategy is to besiege walled cities. Sieges are costly,
  time-consuming, and often result in significant casualties. They should be avoided unless
  absolutely necessary, as they can drain resources and morale.

#### 4. The Drawbacks of Sieges

- Sun Tzu advises against besieging walled cities due to the extensive preparation and resources
  required. Preparing mantlets, movable shelters, and other siege implements can take months, and
  the process of building mounds against the walls can take even longer.
- Sieges expose your troops to prolonged danger while the enemy remains protected. The frustration
  of a prolonged siege can lead to rash decisions, resulting in unnecessary casualties and
  potentially failing to capture the city.

#### Summary

In this passage, Sun Tzu outlines a hierarchy of strategies, emphasizing the importance of strategic
planning and foresight. The goal is to achieve victory with minimal conflict by disrupting the
enemy's plans and avoiding costly engagements like sieges. By understanding and countering the
enemy's strategies, a general can maintain the upper hand and achieve success without unnecessary
loss of life or resources.

### The Consequences of Siege Warfare

> 5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming
>    ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains
>    untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
> 6. Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; he captures their
>    cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in
>    the field.

#### 5. The Disastrous Effects of a Siege

- Sun Tzu describes a scenario where a general, unable to control his irritation, impulsively
  launches an assault on a fortified city. This is likened to swarming ants, highlighting the
  chaotic and uncoordinated nature of such an attack.
- The result of this impatience is catastrophic: a significant portion of the army is lost, yet the
  city remains unconquered. This illustrates the high cost and low success rate of sieges, which
  often lead to unnecessary casualties and resource depletion.
- The passage serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of letting emotions dictate military
  strategy. It underscores the importance of patience and strategic planning over impulsive actions
  driven by frustration.

#### 6. The Skillful Leader's Approach

- In contrast to the disastrous effects of a siege, Sun Tzu describes the approach of a skillful
  leader. Such a leader subdues the enemy's forces without engaging in battle, captures cities
  without laying siege, and overthrows kingdoms without prolonged military campaigns.
- This approach emphasizes the use of strategy, diplomacy, and psychological tactics to achieve
  victory. By undermining the enemy's position and will to fight, a skillful leader can achieve
  total victory with minimal conflict and resource expenditure.
- The passage highlights the value of strategic thinking and the ability to achieve objectives
  through indirect means. It suggests that true mastery in warfare lies in achieving goals without
  resorting to violence, thereby preserving both one's own forces and the enemy's resources for
  future use.

#### Summary

This passage contrasts the impulsive and costly nature of sieges with the strategic and efficient
approach of a skillful leader. It underscores the importance of patience, strategic planning, and
the use of indirect tactics to achieve victory with minimal conflict. By avoiding unnecessary
battles and focusing on undermining the enemy's will to fight, a leader can achieve lasting success
and stability.

### Principles of Engagement

> 7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a
>    man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
> 8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to
>    one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.

#### 7. Triumph Through Stratagem

- Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's forces intact while striving for mastery
  over the empire. The idea is to achieve victory without engaging in direct combat, thereby
  preserving the strength and readiness of the army.
- By using stratagem, a leader can achieve complete triumph without losing a single soldier. This
  method involves outsmarting the enemy, using deception, and employing psychological tactics to
  undermine the enemy's will to fight.
- The passage highlights the value of strategic thinking and planning over brute force. A leader who
  can win without fighting demonstrates true mastery of warfare, as they can achieve their
  objectives while conserving resources and minimizing casualties.

#### 8. Rules of Engagement Based on Numerical Superiority

- Sun Tzu provides guidelines on how to engage the enemy based on the relative size of one's forces
  compared to the enemy's. If your forces outnumber the enemy ten to one, you should surround them,
  effectively cutting off their escape routes and options for reinforcement.
- If your forces are five times the size of the enemy's, you should attack directly, leveraging your
  numerical advantage to overwhelm them.
- When your forces are twice as numerous, Sun Tzu advises dividing your army into two. This allows
  for strategic maneuvers, such as attacking from multiple fronts or using one division to distract
  while the other strikes a decisive blow.
- These rules emphasize the importance of adapting one's strategy based on the situation and using
  numerical superiority to one's advantage. They also highlight the need for flexibility and
  creativity in military tactics.

#### Summary

This passage underscores the importance of strategic thinking and the use of stratagem to achieve
victory without direct conflict. By maintaining one's forces intact and employing clever tactics, a
leader can achieve complete triumph with minimal losses. Sun Tzu also provides practical guidelines
for engaging the enemy based on numerical superiority, emphasizing the need for adaptability and
strategic planning in warfare.

### Tactical Decisions Based on Forces

> 9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the
>    enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
> 10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured
>     by the larger force.

#### 9. Strategies Based on Force Comparison

- Sun Tzu provides guidance on how to approach battle based on the relative strength of one's forces
  compared to the enemy's. If the forces are equally matched, it is appropriate to offer battle.
  This implies that when both sides have similar strength, engaging in combat can be a viable option
  as the outcome is uncertain and can be influenced by strategy and tactics.
- If your forces are slightly inferior, Sun Tzu advises avoiding the enemy. This suggests that when
  at a disadvantage, it is wiser to evade direct confrontation and seek opportunities to strengthen
  your position or wait for a more favorable situation.
- In cases where the enemy is significantly stronger, Sun Tzu recommends fleeing. This is a
  pragmatic approach to avoid unnecessary losses and preserve your forces for future opportunities
  when conditions might be more favorable.

#### 10. The Inevitable Outcome of Unequal Forces

- Sun Tzu notes that while a small force may put up a stubborn fight, it will ultimately be captured
  by a larger force. This highlights the practical reality that numerical superiority often leads to
  victory in direct confrontations.
- The passage underscores the importance of recognizing when the odds are against you and adapting
  your strategy accordingly. It suggests that persistence alone is not enough to overcome a
  significant disparity in strength, and strategic withdrawal or avoidance may be necessary.

#### Summary

This passage emphasizes the importance of assessing the relative strength of forces before engaging
in battle. It provides practical advice on when to fight, avoid, or flee based on the situation. Sun
Tzu highlights the inevitability of defeat for smaller forces against significantly larger ones,
underscoring the need for strategic adaptability and the avoidance of unnecessary conflict when
outmatched.

### The Role of the General

> 11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is complete at all points; the
>     State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.

#### The Role of the General as the Bulwark of the State

- Sun Tzu emphasizes the critical role of the general in the strength and stability of the state. He
  likens the general to a bulwark, or a defensive wall, that protects the state. If this bulwark is
  complete and strong at all points, the state will be robust and secure.
- Conversely, if the bulwark is defective or weak, the state will be vulnerable and fragile. This
  analogy underscores the importance of the general's competence and ability to lead effectively.
- The general's role is not just about leading troops in battle but also about ensuring the overall
  strategic and operational readiness of the military. A capable general must be thoroughly versed
  in military strategy and tactics, as any deficiency in their ability can lead to weaknesses in the
  army and, by extension, the state.

#### Summary

This passage highlights the indispensable role of the general in maintaining the strength and
security of the state. Sun Tzu uses the metaphor of a bulwark to illustrate how the general's
competence and strategic acumen are crucial to the state's resilience. A strong and capable general
ensures that the military is effective and that the state remains protected from external threats.
This underscores the broader theme in "The Art of War" that leadership and strategy are paramount in
warfare.

### Misfortunes in Command

> 12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:—
> 13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot
>     obey. This is called hobbling the army.
> 14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being
>     ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s
>     minds.
> 15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the
>     military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.

#### 12. Three Ways a Ruler Can Bring Misfortune Upon His Army

Sun Tzu outlines three critical mistakes a ruler can make that can lead to the downfall of their
army. These mistakes highlight the importance of understanding military operations and the distinct
nature of military leadership compared to civil governance.

#### 13. Hobbling the Army

- The first mistake is commanding the army to advance or retreat without understanding the army's
  capabilities or the situation on the ground. This is referred to as "hobbling the army," akin to
  tying the legs of a horse, rendering it unable to move effectively.
- Such orders can lead to confusion and inefficiency, as the army may be unable to comply due to
  logistical constraints or tactical disadvantages. This mistake underscores the importance of
  informed decision-making and the need for the ruler to trust the general's judgment in military
  matters.

#### 14. Governing the Army Like a Kingdom

- The second mistake is attempting to govern the army in the same manner as a kingdom, without
  recognizing the unique conditions and requirements of military operations. This approach can cause
  restlessness and dissatisfaction among soldiers.
- Military leadership requires flexibility, adaptability, and a focus on discipline and strategy,
  which differ from the principles of civil governance. The ruler must understand these differences
  to maintain morale and effectiveness within the army.

#### 15. Employing Officers Without Discrimination

- The third mistake is employing officers without considering their suitability for specific roles,
  due to ignorance of the military principle of adapting to circumstances. This can shake the
  confidence of the soldiers and undermine the army's effectiveness.
- It is crucial to assign the right people to the right positions based on their skills and the
  demands of the situation. A failure to do so can lead to poor leadership and decision-making,
  ultimately weakening the army's performance.

#### Summary

This passage highlights the potential pitfalls a ruler can encounter when interfering with military
operations without proper understanding. It emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making,
recognizing the distinct nature of military leadership, and the careful selection of officers. By
avoiding these mistakes, a ruler can ensure the army remains effective and capable of achieving its
objectives.

### Consequences of Army Discontent

> 16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal
>     princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.

#### Restlessness and Distrust in the Army

- Sun Tzu warns that when an army becomes restless and distrustful, it creates an environment ripe
  for trouble, particularly from other feudal princes. This restlessness can stem from poor
  leadership, unclear commands, or a lack of confidence in the leadership.
- Such a state within the army is akin to inviting chaos or anarchy, which undermines the army's
  cohesion and effectiveness. When soldiers are not unified or confident in their leaders, they are
  less likely to perform well in battle, making them vulnerable to external threats.
- The passage emphasizes the importance of maintaining discipline, trust, and morale within the
  army. A well-led army is cohesive and confident, whereas an army plagued by distrust is prone to
  internal strife and external exploitation.

#### Bringing Anarchy and Flinging Victory Away

- Sun Tzu describes the situation as "bringing anarchy into the army," which suggests a breakdown of
  order and discipline. This chaos can lead to missed opportunities and the squandering of potential
  victories.
- By failing to maintain a stable and trusting environment, a leader effectively throws away the
  chance for success. This highlights the critical role of leadership in ensuring that the army
  remains focused and united in its objectives.

#### Summary

This passage underscores the importance of strong, effective leadership in maintaining the morale
and cohesion of an army. Restlessness and distrust can lead to internal chaos and make the army
vulnerable to external threats. By ensuring discipline and trust within the ranks, a leader can
prevent anarchy and maximize the chances of victory.

### Essentials for Victory

> 17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to
>     fight and when not to fight. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and
>     inferior forces. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its
>     ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. (5) He will
>     win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. Victory lies in the
>     knowledge of these five points.

#### Five Essentials for Victory

Sun Tzu outlines five key principles that are essential for achieving victory in warfare. These
principles emphasize strategic thinking, adaptability, and effective leadership.

#### 1. Knowing When to Fight and When Not to Fight

- The first essential is the ability to discern the right moments to engage in battle and when to
  avoid it. This requires a deep understanding of the situation, including the strengths and
  weaknesses of both your own forces and the enemy's.
- By choosing battles wisely, a leader can conserve resources and avoid unnecessary losses,
  positioning their forces for success when conditions are favorable.

#### 2. Handling Both Superior and Inferior Forces

- The second essential is the ability to effectively manage forces regardless of their size relative
  to the enemy. This involves employing the right strategies and tactics to maximize the
  effectiveness of your forces, whether they are superior or inferior in number.
- A skilled leader can leverage the strengths of their forces and exploit the weaknesses of the
  enemy, even when outnumbered.

#### 3. Unity of Spirit Throughout the Ranks

- The third essential is ensuring that the entire army is animated by the same spirit and purpose.
  This unity of purpose and morale is crucial for maintaining cohesion and effectiveness in battle.
- When all ranks are aligned with the commander's intent, the army can act as a cohesive unit,
  increasing its chances of success.

#### 4. Preparedness and Taking the Enemy Unprepared

- The fourth essential is being well-prepared and ready to exploit the enemy's lack of preparation.
  This involves constant readiness and the ability to seize opportunities when the enemy is
  vulnerable.
- By catching the enemy off guard, a prepared army can gain a significant advantage and achieve
  victory with minimal resistance.

#### 5. Military Capacity and Autonomy from the Sovereign

- The fifth essential is having the military capacity to execute strategies effectively and not
  being interfered with by the sovereign. This means that the general must have the autonomy to make
  tactical decisions without undue influence from political leaders.
- A general who is free to act based on their expertise and understanding of the battlefield can
  lead more effectively and adapt to changing circumstances.

#### Summary

This passage highlights the importance of strategic acumen, adaptability, and effective leadership
in achieving victory. By knowing when to fight, managing forces effectively, maintaining unity,
being prepared, and having the autonomy to act, a leader can maximize their chances of success.
These principles underscore the value of strategy and preparation over sheer force in warfare.

### Knowledge as a Key to Success

> 18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a
>     hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will
>     also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every
>     battle.

#### Knowing the Enemy and Knowing Yourself

- Sun Tzu emphasizes the critical importance of understanding both the enemy and oneself in warfare.
  This knowledge is fundamental to achieving consistent success in battles. If you have a thorough
  understanding of both your own capabilities and those of your enemy, you can confidently face
  numerous battles without fear of defeat.
- The passage suggests that self-awareness alone is insufficient. If you know yourself but not the
  enemy, your victories will be inconsistent, as you will be unprepared for the enemy's strategies
  and tactics. This lack of understanding can lead to unexpected defeats, even if you occasionally
  achieve victories.
- The worst scenario is knowing neither the enemy nor yourself. In such cases, you are likely to
  fail in every battle because you lack the necessary insight to make informed strategic decisions.
  This ignorance leaves you vulnerable to the enemy's actions and unable to leverage your own
  strengths effectively.

#### Strategic Implications

- This principle underscores the importance of intelligence and reconnaissance in military strategy.
  Gathering information about the enemy's strengths, weaknesses, and intentions is crucial for
  planning effective strategies and tactics.
- Similarly, self-awareness involves understanding your own strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities.
  This knowledge allows you to make strategic decisions that maximize your advantages and mitigate
  your vulnerabilities.

#### Summary

This passage highlights the foundational principle that knowledge is power in warfare. By
understanding both the enemy and oneself, a leader can make informed strategic decisions that lead
to consistent success. The passage underscores the importance of intelligence, self-awareness, and
strategic planning in achieving victory.

## Chapter IV: Tactical Dispositions

Chapter IV of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War," titled "Tactical Dispositions," focuses on the strategic
positioning and preparation necessary for success in warfare. Here are the key points and concepts
discussed in this chapter:

1. **Preparation and Invincibility**:

    - Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of making oneself invincible before seeking to defeat the
      enemy. This involves securing one's position and ensuring that defeat is impossible through
      careful planning and preparation.
    - The opportunity to defeat the enemy arises from the enemy's mistakes, not solely from one's
      own actions.

2. **Defensive and Offensive Tactics**:

    - Security against defeat is achieved through defensive tactics, while the ability to defeat the
      enemy requires taking the offensive.
    - A strong defense indicates a lack of strength, whereas a strong offense shows an abundance of
      strength.

3. **Secrecy and Surprise**:

    - A skilled general conceals his defensive positions and strikes with surprise, akin to a
      thunderbolt, ensuring that the enemy is unprepared.
    - This dual approach ensures both protection and the potential for a decisive victory.

4. **Excellence in Strategy**:

    - True excellence in warfare is not recognized by obvious victories or public acclaim but by the
      ability to win with ease and without mistakes.
    - A clever fighter wins by making no errors, ensuring victory over an already defeated enemy.

5. **Strategic Planning**:

    - The chapter outlines a structured approach to military strategy, involving measurement,
      estimation of quantities, calculation, balancing of chances, and ultimately achieving victory.
    - These elements are interconnected, with each step building upon the previous one to ensure a
      well-calculated approach to warfare.

6. **Victory and Strength**:
    - A victorious army is compared to a heavy weight against a light one, highlighting the
      overwhelming advantage of a well-prepared and disciplined force.
    - The momentum of a conquering force is likened to the release of pent-up waters, emphasizing
      the power and inevitability of a well-executed strategy.

#### Summary

Chapter IV of "The Art of War" teaches that success in warfare is achieved through meticulous
preparation, strategic positioning, and the ability to adapt to the enemy's mistakes. Sun Tzu
advocates for a balance between defensive and offensive tactics, emphasizing the importance of
secrecy, surprise, and error-free execution. The chapter underscores the significance of strategic
planning and the interconnectedness of various elements that lead to victory. These timeless
principles remain relevant in both military and non-military contexts, highlighting the importance
of preparation, adaptability, and strategic foresight.

### The Nature of Victory and Defeat

> 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat,
>    and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
> 2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the
>    enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
> 3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of
>    defeating the enemy.
> 4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.

This passage highlights several key strategic principles related to preparation, defense, and the
nature of victory. Let's break down each part of the passage:

1. **"The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then
   waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."**

    - **Preparation and Defense**: This statement emphasizes the importance of securing one's own
      position before attempting to defeat the enemy. Good fighters ensure that they are
      invulnerable to defeat through careful planning and strong defensive measures.

    - **Patience and Timing**: Once a secure position is established, they patiently wait for the
      right moment to strike, which often comes from the enemy's mistakes or weaknesses.

2. **"To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the
   enemy is provided by the enemy himself."**

    - **Control Over Defense**: Sun Tzu points out that while we have control over our own defenses
      and can ensure our security through our actions, the chance to defeat the enemy depends on the
      enemy's actions and errors.

    - **Exploiting Opportunities**: This highlights the importance of being vigilant and ready to
      exploit opportunities when they arise, rather than forcing an attack prematurely.

3. **"Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of
   defeating the enemy."**

    - **Focus on Invincibility**: A skilled strategist focuses on making their position
      unassailable. This ensures that they cannot be defeated, even if they cannot guarantee victory
      over the enemy.

    - **Uncertainty of Victory**: The outcome of defeating the enemy is uncertain because it relies
      on factors beyond one's control, such as the enemy's mistakes or vulnerabilities.

4. **"Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it."**

    - **Knowledge vs. Execution**: This aphorism underscores the difference between understanding
      the principles of victory and being able to execute them. Knowing how to win does not always
      translate into actual victory because execution depends on circumstances and opportunities
      that may not always be present.

    - **Strategic Wisdom**: It reflects the wisdom that even with perfect knowledge and preparation,
      external factors can influence the outcome, and one must be adaptable and patient.

#### Summary

This passage teaches that the foundation of successful strategy lies in preparation and defense.
While one can control their own security, the opportunity to defeat the enemy often depends on
external factors.

A good strategist focuses on making themselves invincible and remains patient, waiting for the right
moment to strike. This highlights the importance of adaptability, patience, and the understanding
that knowledge alone does not guarantee victory.

### Defensive vs. Offensive Tactics

> 5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the
>    offensive.
> 6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of
>    strength.
> 7. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is
>    skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we
>    have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.

This passage discusses the balance between defensive and offensive tactics, and the qualities of a
skilled general. Let's break down each part of the passage:

1. **"Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking
   the offensive."**

    - **Defensive vs. Offensive Tactics**: Sun Tzu highlights that ensuring one's own security and
      avoiding defeat is primarily achieved through defensive strategies. These tactics focus on
      protecting and fortifying one's position.

    - **Offensive for Victory**: Conversely, the ability to defeat the enemy requires taking the
      offensive. This involves actively engaging and attacking the enemy to exploit their weaknesses
      and secure victory.

2. **"Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of
   strength."**

    - **Strength and Strategy**: This statement suggests that relying solely on defense may indicate
      a lack of strength or resources. It implies that a force that is primarily defensive may not
      have the capability to launch an effective attack.

    - **Offensive as a Sign of Strength**: On the other hand, a force that can afford to attack
      demonstrates an abundance of strength and resources. This shows confidence and the capability
      to take the initiative in battle.

3. **"The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who
   is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we
   have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete."**

    - **Secrecy and Surprise**: A skilled general in defense uses secrecy and concealment to protect
      their position, making it difficult for the enemy to locate or attack them effectively. This
      metaphorically means hiding "in the most secret recesses of the earth".

    - **Decisive and Sudden Attacks**: A skilled attacker, however, strikes with speed and surprise,
      akin to a sudden and powerful force "from the topmost heights of heaven." This ensures that
      the attack is overwhelming and leaves the enemy unprepared.

    - **Balanced Strategy**: The passage concludes by emphasizing the importance of balancing
      defensive capabilities with the ability to execute a decisive offensive. This balance ensures
      both protection and the potential for a complete victory.

### The Essence of True Excellence

> 8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
> 9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well
>    done!"
> 10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp
>     sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.

This passage discusses the nature of true excellence in military strategy and the perception of
victory. Let's break down each part of the passage:

1. **"To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of
   excellence."**

    - **Foreseeing Victory**: Sun Tzu emphasizes that true strategic excellence involves the ability
      to foresee victory before it becomes apparent to everyone else. Recognizing victory only when
      it is obvious to the masses does not demonstrate superior skill or insight.

    - **Strategic Insight**: The ability to predict and plan for victory before it is evident to
      others is a mark of a truly skilled strategist. This requires deep understanding and
      foresight.

2. **"Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, 'Well
   done!'"**

    - **Public Recognition**: Achieving victory and receiving widespread acclaim is not the highest
      form of excellence. Sun Tzu suggests that true excellence lies in achieving success without
      the need for public recognition or praise.

    - **Subtlety in Strategy**: The best strategies are those that achieve their goals quietly and
      efficiently, without drawing attention to themselves.

3. **"To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp
   sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear."**

    - **Obvious Achievements**: Sun Tzu uses metaphors to illustrate that accomplishing tasks that
      are easy or obvious does not demonstrate exceptional ability. Lifting a light object, seeing
      obvious celestial bodies, or hearing loud noises are not indicators of great strength, sharp
      sight, or quick hearing.

    - **True Skill**: True skill and excellence are demonstrated through subtlety and the ability to
      achieve difficult tasks that are not immediately apparent to others.

#### Summary

This passage highlights the importance of subtlety, foresight, and true strategic excellence.
Recognizing victory before it is obvious to others and achieving success without seeking public
acclaim are marks of a truly skilled strategist. Sun Tzu emphasizes that true strength and skill are
demonstrated through subtle and difficult achievements, rather than through obvious or easy tasks.
This perspective encourages a focus on strategic insight and the ability to achieve goals quietly
and efficiently.

### Characteristics of a Clever Fighter

> 11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with
>     ease.
> 12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.
> 13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the
>     certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.

This passage focuses on the qualities of a truly skilled fighter and the nature of victory. Let's
break down each part of the passage:

1. **"What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with
   ease."**

    - **Effortless Victory**: Sun Tzu emphasizes that a truly clever fighter is not just someone who
      wins battles, but someone who does so with ease. This implies a level of skill and strategy
      that allows for victories to be achieved without unnecessary effort or struggle.

    - **Strategic Mastery**: Winning with ease suggests that the fighter has mastered the art of
      strategy, allowing them to overcome challenges smoothly and efficiently.

2. **"Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage."**

    - **Lack of Recognition**: Because the victories are achieved with such ease, they may not be
      recognized as feats of great wisdom or courage. The simplicity and efficiency of the victories
      make them appear less remarkable to outsiders.

    - **Subtle Excellence**: This highlights the idea that true excellence in strategy is often
      subtle and may not be immediately apparent to others. The clever fighter's success is so
      seamless that it doesn't draw attention or accolades.

3. **"He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the
   certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated."**

    - **Error-Free Strategy**: The key to the clever fighter's success is the absence of mistakes.
      By avoiding errors, the fighter ensures that their strategy is sound and that victory is
      almost guaranteed.

    - **Preemptive Victory**: By making no mistakes, the fighter effectively defeats an enemy that
      is already compromised or weakened. This proactive approach ensures that the battle is won
      before it even begins, as the enemy is already at a disadvantage.

#### Summary

This passage highlights the qualities of a truly skilled fighter, emphasizing the importance of
winning with ease and without mistakes. True strategic excellence is subtle and may not be
recognized as wisdom or courage because the victories are achieved so effortlessly. The clever
fighter's success lies in their ability to avoid errors, ensuring that the enemy is already defeated
before the battle begins. This approach underscores the importance of strategic foresight and
meticulous planning in achieving victory.

### Strategic Positioning

> 14. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does
>     not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
> 15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been
>     won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.

This passage emphasizes the importance of strategic positioning and planning in warfare. Let's break
down each part of the passage:

1. **"Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and
   does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy."**

    - **Strategic Positioning**: A skillful fighter ensures that their position is so secure that
      defeat is impossible. This involves careful planning, preparation, and choosing the right
      ground or circumstances to fight.

    - **Timing and Opportunity**: Beyond securing a strong position, the skillful fighter is also
      adept at recognizing and seizing the right moment to defeat the enemy. This requires vigilance
      and the ability to act decisively when the opportunity arises.

2. **"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been
   won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."**

    - **Preemptive Victory**: The victorious strategist plans and prepares so thoroughly that the
      outcome of victory is assured before the battle even begins. This means that the strategist
      has already set the conditions for success through careful planning and strategic positioning.

    - **Reactive vs. Proactive**: In contrast, a less skilled strategist engages in battle without

### The Dynamics of Forces

> 19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound’s weight placed in the scale against
>     a single grain.
> 20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a
>     thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical dispositions.

This passage uses vivid metaphors to illustrate the overwhelming advantage of a well-prepared and
victorious army. Let's break down each part of the passage:

1. **"A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound’s weight placed in the scale against
   a single grain."**

    - **Overwhelming Advantage**: Sun Tzu compares the strength of a victorious army to a pound's
      weight and the weakness of a defeated, or routed, army to a single grain. This metaphor
      highlights the immense disparity in power and effectiveness between a well-prepared, confident
      force and a demoralized, disorganized one.

    - **Inevitability of Victory**: The comparison suggests that the outcome of such a confrontation
      is almost certain. The victorious army, with its superior strength and morale, will easily
      overpower the routed enemy, much like a heavy weight easily tips the scale against a tiny
      grain.

2. **"The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a
   thousand fathoms deep."**

    - **Irresistible Force**: This metaphor describes the unstoppable momentum of a conquering army.
      Just as pent-up waters burst forth with tremendous force and energy, a well-prepared and
      victorious army advances with overwhelming power and speed.

    - **Decisive Impact**: The imagery of water rushing into a deep chasm emphasizes the decisive
      and all-encompassing nature of the attack. The conquering force sweeps away all resistance,
      leaving no room for the enemy to regroup or counterattack.

3. **"So much for tactical dispositions."**

    - **Conclusion of Tactical Discussion**: This phrase serves as a concluding remark on the topic
      of tactical dispositions. Sun Tzu summarizes the essence of effective tactical positioning and
      preparation, emphasizing the importance of creating conditions that lead to overwhelming
      victory.

#### Summary

This passage uses powerful metaphors to convey the overwhelming advantage of a victorious and
well-prepared army. The comparison of a victorious army to a pound's weight against a single grain
illustrates the disparity in strength between a confident force and a defeated one. The metaphor of
bursting waters emphasizes the unstoppable momentum and decisive impact of a conquering force. Sun
Tzu concludes his discussion on tactical dispositions by highlighting the importance of creating
conditions that ensure overwhelming victory.
