# Commentary on the Deuterocanon

The Deuterocanon refers to a collection of books and additions to books that are included in the Old
Testament of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles but are not found in the Hebrew Bible or
most Protestant Bibles. Here's a detailed explanation:

#### Definition and Meaning

- **Deuterocanonical**: The term "Deuterocanonical" means "second canon." It is used to describe
  books that are considered canonical by some Christian traditions but are not part of the Hebrew
  Bible. These books are included in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,
  and are accepted by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches as part of the biblical
  canon.

#### Historical Context

- **Intertestamental Period**: The Deuterocanonical books were written during the intertestamental
  period, which is the time between the Old and New Testaments. This period is also known as the
  "400 years of silence" because it is believed that there were no prophetic writings during this
  time.
- **Cultural Influence**: During this period, the Jewish people were under the influence of
  Hellenistic culture, which is reflected in the language and themes of the Deuterocanonical books.
  The books were originally written in Greek, which was the lingua franca of the time due to the
  conquests of Alexander the Great.

#### List of Deuterocanonical Books

The Deuterocanonical books include:

- Tobit

- 2 Esdras
- Prayer of Manasseh
- 3 Maccabees
- 4 Maccabees
- Psalm 151 (accepted by the Eastern Orthodox Church).

#### Canonical Status

- **Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches**: These churches consider the Deuterocanonical
  books to be divinely inspired and include them in their canon. The Roman Catholic Church affirmed
  their status at the Council of Trent in 1546.
- **Protestant Churches**: Most Protestant denominations do not consider these books to be divinely
  inspired and refer to them as the Apocrypha. They may be included in some Protestant Bibles as a
  separate section for historical and educational purposes.

#### Importance and Influence

- **Theological and Historical Insight**: The Deuterocanonical books provide valuable historical and
  theological insights into Jewish life and thought during the intertestamental period. They include
  narratives, wisdom literature, and additions to canonical books that enrich the understanding of
  Jewish history and beliefs.
- **Controversial Doctrines**: Some doctrines, such as purgatory and indulgences, find support in
  the Deuterocanonical books, particularly in 2 Maccabees. This has been a point of contention
  between different Christian traditions.

In summary, the Deuterocanonical books are an important part of the biblical canon for certain
Christian traditions, offering historical, cultural, and theological insights. Their acceptance
varies among different Christian denominations, reflecting broader differences in biblical
interpretation and tradition.

## Judith

The Book of Judith is part of the Deuterocanonical books of the Bible, which are included in the
Catholic and Orthodox Christian Old Testament but are not part of the Hebrew Bible or Protestant Old
Testament. It is a story that highlights God's deliverance of the Jewish people through the actions
of a courageous woman named Judith.

#### Key Themes and Storyline

- **Historical Context and Fictional Elements**: The book is set during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,
  who is inaccurately described as the king of Assyria instead of Babylon. This anachronism, along
  with other historical inaccuracies, suggests that the book is not meant to be a historical account
  but rather a work of historical fiction or a parable.
- **Judith's Heroic Act**: The central narrative revolves around Judith, a devout and beautiful
  widow, who saves her people from the Assyrian army led by General Holofernes. She uses her wit and
  charm to gain access to Holofernes' camp, ultimately beheading him while he is drunk, which leads
  to the defeat of the Assyrian forces.
- **Symbolism and Literary Style**: Judith's actions are symbolic of God's deliverance through
  unexpected means, similar to other biblical figures like Jael and Deborah. The book uses irony and
  double entendres, such as Judith's ambiguous use of "my lord" when speaking to Holofernes, to
  enhance its narrative.

#### Literary and Theological Significance

- **Genre and Interpretation**: The Book of Judith is often interpreted as a parable or a "roman à
  clef," a story with a hidden meaning or allegory. This interpretation is supported by the
  deliberate historical inaccuracies, which signal to the reader that the story is not a
  straightforward historical account.
- **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: Judith's deception and the killing of Holofernes raise
  ethical questions similar to those found in other biblical stories where deception is used for a
  greater good, such as the actions of Rahab or the Hebrew midwives.
- **Canonical Status**: Despite its exclusion from the Jewish and Protestant canons, the Book of
  Judith has been valued in Christian tradition. It was included in the Septuagint and the Vulgate
  and was affirmed by the Council of Trent as part of the Catholic canon.

#### Conclusion

The Book of Judith is a rich narrative that combines elements of historical fiction, parable, and
theological reflection. It emphasizes themes of faith, courage, and divine intervention, using the
character of Judith as a symbol of God's ability to deliver His people through unexpected means. The
book's literary style and symbolic content have made it a subject of interest for theologians,
historians, and literary scholars alike.

additions not found in the Hebrew version. These additions were made to emphasize the religious
aspects of the story and to address contemporary issues of anti-Semitism during the time of Greek
and Roman influence. Here is a detailed explanation of these Greek additions:

   symbolizing the conflict between the Jews and their enemies. This dream is interpreted later in
   the text.

2. **Edict of King Artaxerxes**: This edict, attributed to King Artaxerxes (likely Xerxes), contains
   arguments from classical anti-Semitism and is directed against the Jews. It reflects the
   historical context of anti-Jewish sentiment.

3. **Prayers of Mordecai and Esther**: These prayers are added to provide a religious dimension to
   the story. Mordecai's prayer explains his refusal to bow to Haman, while Esther's prayer
   expresses her distress over her marriage to a non-Jewish king.

   describing how the king's mood changes favorably when Esther faints, highlighting divine
   intervention.

   plotted against the king to transfer the Persian kingdom to the Macedonians. This decree reverses
   the earlier edict against the Jews.

6. **Interpretation of Mordecai's Dream and Colophon**: The dream is interpreted, and a colophon
   provides historical context, dating the additions to the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and
   Cleopatra (114 BCE), indicating they were written in Egypt under the Ptolemies.

#### Historical and Cultural Context

- The Greek additions to Esther were likely made to address the religious and social needs of Jews
  living under Greek and Roman rule, where anti-Semitism was prevalent.
- These additions emphasize God's intervention and the religious significance of the events, which
  are not explicitly mentioned in the Hebrew version of Esther.
- The Greek version of Esther is part of the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible,
  and is considered canonical by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches but not by most
  Protestant denominations.

#### Summary

The Greek additions to the Book of Esther serve to highlight the religious dimensions of the story
and address the socio-political challenges faced by Jews during the Hellenistic period. These
additions provide a richer narrative that underscores themes of divine intervention and the struggle
against anti-Semitism, making the story more relevant to its contemporary audience.

  of the Babylonian captivity of the Jews, a significant period in Jewish history.
- **The Siege of Jerusalem**: Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of Jerusalem is depicted as an act allowed
  by God, who delivered Jehoiakim into the Babylonian king's hands. This reflects the biblical theme
  of divine sovereignty over historical events.

#### The Captivity and Selection of Young Men

- **Exile to Babylon**: Nebuchadnezzar takes some of the vessels from the temple in Jerusalem and
  brings them to the house of his god in Babylon, symbolizing the subjugation of the God of Israel
  to the Babylonian gods.

  from the royal family and nobility of Israel to serve in his palace. These youths are to be
  without physical defect, handsome, and knowledgeable, indicating a focus on grooming the best and
  brightest for service in the Babylonian court.

#### Daniel and His Companions

- **Names and Identity**: Among the selected youths are Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. They

  renaming signifies an attempt to assimilate them into Babylonian culture and religion.

  water instead, demonstrating his commitment to his faith and identity.

  allowing him to follow his dietary convictions. This highlights the theme of divine intervention
  and support for those who remain faithful.

### Chapter 2

  dream. However, he demands not only the interpretation but also that they tell him the dream
  itself, threatening severe punishment if they fail and promising rewards if they succeed.

#### The Wise Men's Dilemma

- The wise men express that no one on earth can fulfill the king's request, as it is beyond human
  capability. They suggest that only the gods could reveal such secrets, highlighting the
  impossibility of the task.

#### Daniel's Intervention

  captive, seeks time from the king to provide the interpretation. He and his companions pray to God
  for mercy and revelation.

- God reveals the dream and its interpretation to Daniel in a night vision. Daniel praises God for
  His wisdom and power, acknowledging that God reveals deep and secret things.

  He describes the dream of a great statue with various materials representing successive kingdoms.

#### Interpretation of the Dream

- The statue's head of gold represents Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian Empire. The subsequent parts of
  the statue (silver, bronze, iron, and iron mixed with clay) symbolize future empires: Medo-Persia,

### Chapter 3

#### Context and Setting

- King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon created a massive golden image, approximately 90 feet tall and 9
  feet wide, and set it up in the plain of Dura. This was likely a symbol of his power and possibly
  a response to a dream he had in the previous chapter, where he was told his kingdom would not last
  forever.
- Nebuchadnezzar gathered all the high-ranking officials of his kingdom to the dedication of this
  image, indicating that the worship of this image was a test of loyalty to him and his rule.

#### Command to Worship

- A herald announced that everyone must worship the golden image when they heard the sound of
  various musical instruments. Failure to do so would result in being thrown into a fiery furnace, a
  severe punishment meant to enforce compliance.

#### Defiance by Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

- Despite the decree, three Jewish officials, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refused to worship
  the image. This act of defiance was reported to Nebuchadnezzar by certain Chaldeans, likely
  motivated by jealousy or political rivalry.
- When confronted by Nebuchadnezzar, the three men expressed their faith in God, stating that He
  could save them from the furnace, but even if He did not, they would not worship the image.

#### The Fiery Furnace

- Enraged by their defiance, Nebuchadnezzar ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than
  usual and had the three men thrown into it. The heat was so intense that it killed the soldiers
  who cast them in.
- Miraculously, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were unharmed in the furnace. Nebuchadnezzar
  observed a fourth figure in the fire, described as looking like "a son of the gods," which many
  interpret as a divine presence or angel.

#### Deliverance and Recognition

- Nebuchadnezzar called the men out of the furnace, and they emerged without any harm, not even the
  smell of smoke on them. This miraculous event led Nebuchadnezzar to praise the God of Shadrach,
  Meshach, and Abednego, acknowledging His power to save.
- As a result, Nebuchadnezzar decreed that anyone speaking against their God would be punished, and
  he promoted the three men within the province of Babylon.

#### Key Points to Consider

- **Faith and Obedience:** The chapter highlights the unwavering faith and obedience of Shadrach,
  Meshach, and Abednego to God, even in the face of death.
- **Divine Intervention:** The miraculous deliverance from the furnace serves as a testament to
  God's power and presence with those who trust in Him.
- **Recognition of God's Power:** Nebuchadnezzar's acknowledgment of God's power, despite his
  initial arrogance, shows a shift in his understanding, though not necessarily a conversion.
- **Symbolism:** The fiery furnace can be seen as a symbol of trials and tribulations, with the
  presence of the divine figure representing God's protection and deliverance.

#### Summary

Daniel Chapter 3 is a powerful narrative about faith, divine deliverance, and the recognition of
God's sovereignty. It underscores the importance of standing firm in one's beliefs and the
miraculous ways in which God can intervene in the lives of the faithful. The story also serves as a
reminder of the potential for transformation in those who witness God's power, as seen in
Nebuchadnezzar's reaction.

### Chapter 4

- The dream symbolized a man who would lose his sanity and live like an animal until he acknowledged
  that the Most High rules over human kingdoms.

#### Daniel's Interpretation

- Daniel, also known as Belteshazzar, is called upon to interpret the dream after the king's wise
  men fail to do so. Daniel is troubled by the dream's meaning but explains it to Nebuchadnezzar.
- The tree represents Nebuchadnezzar himself, whose greatness and dominion are vast. However, due to
  his pride, he will be driven away from people and live like an animal until he recognizes God's
  sovereignty.

#### Fulfillment of the Dream

- Despite Daniel's warning and advice to repent, Nebuchadnezzar's pride leads to the fulfillment of
  the dream. He boasts about his achievements, and immediately, a voice from heaven declares that
  his kingdom has departed from him.

  acknowledges God's rule.

#### Summary of Events

- **Belshazzar's Feast:** King Belshazzar of Babylon holds a grand feast for a thousand of his
  nobles. During the feast, he orders the use of sacred vessels taken from the temple in Jerusalem
  for drinking wine, which is an act of sacrilege. The attendees praise their idols made of gold,
  silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
- **The Writing on the Wall:** Suddenly, a mysterious hand appears and writes on the wall. This
  terrifies Belshazzar, causing him to call for his wise men to interpret the writing. However, none
  can do so.
- **Daniel's Interpretation:** The queen suggests calling Daniel, known for his wisdom and ability
  to interpret dreams. Daniel is brought before the king and offers to interpret the writing without
  accepting any rewards. He reminds Belshazzar of Nebuchadnezzar's downfall due to pride and warns
  him of his own arrogance and disrespect towards God.
- **The Message:** The writing reads "MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN." Daniel interprets it as a divine
  judgment:

    - **MENE:** God has numbered the days of Belshazzar's reign and brought it to an end.
    - **TEKEL:** Belshazzar has been weighed and found wanting.
    - **PERES (UPHARSIN):** The kingdom will be divided and given to the Medes and Persians.

   Babylon. The feast took place while the city was under siege by the Medo-Persian army.

   fall of a kingdom due to moral and spiritual failure.

   humility and reverence towards God. His refusal of rewards highlights his integrity and devotion
   to truth.

4. **Moral Lesson:** The chapter serves as a warning against pride and idolatry, illustrating the
   consequences of ignoring divine authority and moral responsibility.

#### Best Practices

- **Understanding Context:** When interpreting historical or religious texts, consider the cultural
  and historical context to grasp the full meaning.

### Chapter 6

The text from Daniel Chapter 6 describes a well-known biblical story involving Daniel, King Darius,
and the lion's den. Here's a breakdown of the key elements and themes of this chapter:

#### Key Points

1. **Administrative Structure**: King Darius appointed 120 local governors and three presidents to
   oversee them, with Daniel being one of the presidents. Daniel distinguished himself due to his
   excellent spirit, prompting the king to consider setting him over the entire realm.

2. **Jealousy and Plot**: The other presidents and governors, envious of Daniel's favor with the
   king, sought to find fault in him. Unable to find any wrongdoing, they targeted his religious
   practices, knowing Daniel's faithfulness to his God.

3. **Decree Against Prayer**: They convinced King Darius to issue a decree that prohibited anyone
   from praying to any god or man except the king for thirty days, under penalty of being thrown
   into the lion's den. The king, unaware of the plot against Daniel, signed the decree.

4. **Daniel's Faithfulness**: Despite knowing the decree, Daniel continued his practice of praying
   three times a day with his windows open toward Jerusalem. His enemies caught him in the act and
   reported it to the king.

5. **King's Dilemma and Daniel's Punishment**: King Darius, distressed by the situation but bound by
   the unchangeable law of the Medes and Persians, reluctantly ordered Daniel to be thrown into the
   lion's den. The king expressed hope that Daniel's God would deliver him.

6. **Divine Deliverance**: God sent an angel to shut the lions' mouths, and Daniel was unharmed. The
   next morning, King Darius found Daniel alive and was overjoyed.

7. **Justice and Decree**: The king ordered Daniel's accusers, along with their families, to be
   thrown into the lion's den, where they were killed. Darius then issued a decree acknowledging the
   power and dominion of Daniel's God, commanding reverence for Him throughout the kingdom.

8. **Daniel's Prosperity**: Daniel continued to prosper during the reign of Darius and into the
   reign of Cyrus the Persian.

  deceit, as seen in the actions of Daniel's rivals.
- **Divine Protection**: The miraculous deliverance of Daniel from the lions underscores the theme
  of divine protection for those who are faithful to God.
- **Justice and Retribution**: The fate of Daniel's accusers serves as a narrative of justice and
  retribution, illustrating the biblical principle of reaping what one sows.
- **Recognition of God's Sovereignty**: King Darius's decree after Daniel's deliverance acknowledges
  the sovereignty and eternal dominion of Daniel's God, reinforcing the theme of God's power and
  faithfulness.

This chapter is often interpreted as a testament to the power of faith and the protection that comes
from steadfast devotion to God, even in the face of adversity.

### Chapter 7

Daniel Chapter 7 is a prophetic vision that Daniel had during the first year of King Belshazzar's
reign in Babylon. This chapter is significant because it introduces a series of symbolic visions
that represent future kingdoms and the ultimate establishment of God's eternal kingdom.

#### Key Elements of the Vision

1. **The Four Beasts**:

    - **Lion with Eagle's Wings**: This beast represents the Babylonian Empire. The wings being
      plucked and the beast standing like a man symbolize the humbling of Babylon, possibly
      referring to Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience.
    - **Bear Raised on One Side**: This beast symbolizes the Medo-Persian Empire. The bear's uneven
      stance and the three ribs in its mouth likely represent its conquests over Babylon, Lydia, and
      Egypt.
    - **Leopard with Four Wings and Four Heads**: This represents the Greek Empire under Alexander
      the Great. The four wings indicate the swiftness of Alexander's conquests, and the four heads
      symbolize the division of his empire into four parts after his death.
    - **Terrifying Beast with Iron Teeth and Ten Horns**: This beast is often interpreted as the
      Roman Empire. The ten horns represent ten kings or kingdoms that arise from this empire. The
      little horn that emerges and uproots three others is often associated with a future ruler,
      sometimes identified as the Antichrist.

2. **The Ancient of Days**:

    - This figure represents God, depicted as sitting on a fiery throne, surrounded by countless
      attendants. The scene is one of judgment, where the books are opened, and the beasts'
      dominions are judged.

3. **The Son of Man**:

    - This figure, coming with the clouds of heaven, is given dominion, glory, and a kingdom that
      will never be destroyed. This is often interpreted as a prophecy of Jesus Christ, who referred
      to Himself as the "Son of Man."

4. **Interpretation of the Vision**:

    - Daniel is troubled by the vision and seeks understanding. He is told that the four beasts
      represent four kingdoms that will arise on earth. However, the saints of the Most High will
      eventually receive the kingdom and possess it forever.

5. **The Fourth Beast and the Little Horn**:
    - The fourth beast is described as different from the others, exceedingly dreadful, and it will
      devour the whole earth. The little horn will speak against the Most High and persecute the
      saints for a time, times, and half a time (interpreted as three and a half years). However,
      its dominion will be taken away, and the kingdom will be given to the saints.

#### Summary

Daniel 7 is a prophetic vision that outlines the rise and fall of four major empires, culminating in
the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. The vision uses symbolic imagery to convey the power and
nature of these empires and the ultimate triumph of divine authority. The chapter emphasizes God's
sovereignty over human history and the eventual victory of His kingdom.

Belshazzar. This vision is rich in symbolism and prophecy, and it is interpreted within the chapter
itself. Here's a breakdown of the key elements and their interpretations:

#### Key Elements of the Vision

1. **The Ram with Two Horns:**

      nature of the empire, with one horn being higher, indicating the dominance of Persia over
      Media.
    - **Actions:** The ram pushes westward, northward, and southward, signifying the expansion of
      the Medo-Persian Empire in those directions.

      eyes symbolizing Alexander the Great.
    - **Actions:** The goat attacks the ram with great fury, breaking its horns and trampling it,
      symbolizing the Greek conquest of the Medo-Persian Empire.

3. **The Four Horns:**

    - **Symbolism:** After the notable horn is broken, four horns arise, representing the division
      of Alexander's empire into four parts after his death.
    - **Historical Context:** These four parts were ruled by Alexander's generals: Cassander,
      Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy.

4. **The Little Horn:**

    - **Symbolism:** The little horn that grows exceedingly great represents Antiochus IV Epiphanes,
      a ruler from the Seleucid Empire known for his persecution of the Jews and desecration of the
      temple.
    - **Actions:** This horn grows towards the south, east, and the "glorious land" (Israel), and it
      exalts itself against the "Prince of the host," stopping daily sacrifices and casting truth to
      the ground.

5. **The Duration of the Vision:**
    - **Prophecy:** The vision includes a prophecy of 2,300 evenings and mornings, after which the

      and the eventual restoration of the temple.

#### Interpretation and Historical Context

- **Gabriel's Explanation:** The angel Gabriel explains to Daniel that the vision pertains to the
  "time of the end," indicating both a near-term fulfillment in Antiochus IV and a potential future
  fulfillment in the Antichrist.
- **Historical Fulfillment:** The vision accurately predicts the rise and fall of empires and
  rulers, specifically the Medo-Persian and Greek empires, and the actions of Antiochus IV.

  Babylonian name Belteshazzar, receives a revelation. This period is significant because it follows
  the return of some Jewish exiles to Jerusalem under Zerubbabel's leadership.
- Daniel is in a state of mourning for three weeks, abstaining from rich foods, meat, and wine, and
  not anointing himself. This period of mourning might be due to the challenges faced by the
  returning exiles or the long duration of the prophecy he received.

#### Vision by the River

- On the 24th day of the first month, Daniel is by the Tigris River (referred to as Hiddekel) when
  he sees a man clothed in linen with a striking appearance. This figure's description is similar to
  angelic or divine beings, with features like a body like beryl, a face like lightning, and eyes
  like flaming torches.

  appearance of Christ, while others believe it to be a high-ranking angel.

#### Daniel's Reaction and the Angelic Message

- Daniel's companions do not see the vision but are overcome with fear and flee. Daniel himself is
  left weak and falls into a deep sleep with his face to the ground.
- A hand touches Daniel, strengthening him, and he is addressed as "greatly beloved." The figure
  reassures Daniel and explains that his prayers were heard from the first day he began to pray.
  However, the "prince of the kingdom of Persia" resisted the messenger for 21 days until Michael, a
  chief prince, came to assist.
- This passage highlights the spiritual warfare occurring behind the scenes, with angelic beings
  battling demonic forces. The "prince of Persia" is understood to be a demonic entity opposing

   of mere chance and that after death, they will be forgotten, as if they never existed.

2. **Hedonism**: Based on their belief in the futility of life, the wicked decide to indulge in
   pleasures and enjoy the material world to the fullest. They advocate for a life of revelry, using
   creation for their enjoyment, and leaving behind tokens of mirth.

3. **Oppression of the Righteous**: The wicked express a desire to oppress the righteous and
   vulnerable, such as the poor, widows, and the elderly. They see strength as the only law of

   righteous man who reproaches them for their sins. They are annoyed by his presence and decide to
