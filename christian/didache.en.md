# Commentary on the Didache

## Overview

The Didache, also known as "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," is an early Christian treatise

### Key Points

  AD, though some scholars suggest it could be from the early second century. It is a composite

    4. **Eschatological Teachings**: The final section contains prophecies about the Antichrist and
       the Second Coming of Christ.

- **Baptism and Eucharist**: The Didache provides specific instructions for baptism, which should be
  performed in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, preferably in flowing water. It also
  includes prayers for the Eucharist, highlighting its significance as a communal meal and act of
  thanksgiving.

  the commandments. It includes teachings similar to those found in the Gospels, such as the Great
  Commandment and the Golden Rule.

  highly regarded by some early Church Fathers and influenced later Christian writings and church
  orders. It provides valuable insights into the transition from Jewish to Gentile Christianity and
  the development of early Christian practices.

## Chapter 1: The Two Ways; The First Commandment

> There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but a great difference between the two ways. The
> way of life, then, is this: First, thou shalt love God who made thee; second, thy neighbour as
> thyself; and all things whatsoever thou wouldst should not occur to thee, thou also to another do
> not do. And of these sayings the teaching is this: Bless them that curse you, and pray for your
> enemies, and fast for them that persecute you. For what thank is there, if ye love them that love
> you? Do not also the Gentiles do the same? But do ye love them that hate you; and ye shall not
> have an enemy. Abstain thou from fleshly and worldly lusts. If one give thee a blow upon thy right
> cheek, turn to him the other also; and thou shalt be perfect. If one impress thee for one mile, go
> with him two. If one take away thy cloak, give him also thy coat. If one take from thee thine own,
> ask it not back, for indeed thou art not able. Give to every one that asketh thee, and ask it not
> back; for the Father willeth that to all should be given of our own blessings (free gifts). Happy
> is he that giveth according to the commandment; for he is guiltless. Woe to him that receiveth;
> for if one having need receiveth, he is guiltless; but he that receiveth not having need, shall
> pay the penalty, why he received and for what, and, coming into straits (confinement), he shall be
> examined concerning the things which he hath done, and he shall not escape thence until he pay
> back the last farthing. But also now concerning this, it hath been said, Let thine alms sweat in
> thy hands, until thou know to whom thou shouldst give.

   mile if compelled, and to give freely without expecting anything in return. These teachings
   emphasize humility, generosity, and non-retaliation.

## Chapter 2: The Second Commandment; Gross Sin Forbidden

> adultery, thou shalt not commit pÃ¦derasty, thou shalt not commit fornication, thou shalt not
> steal, thou shalt not practice magic, thou shalt not practice witchcraft, thou shalt not murder a
> child by abortion nor kill that which is begotten. Thou shalt not covet the things of thy
> neighbour, thou shalt not forswear thyself, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not
> speak evil, thou shalt bear no grudge. Thou shalt not be double-minded nor double-tongued; for to
> be double-tongued is a snare of death. Thy speech shall not be false, nor empty, but fulfilled by
> deed. Thou shalt not be covetous, nor rapacious, nor a hypocrite, nor evil disposed, nor haughty.
> Thou shalt not take evil counsel against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not hate any man; but some thou
> shalt reprove, and concerning some thou shalt pray, and some thou shalt love more than thy own

> My child, flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it. Be not prone to anger, for

> all these murders are engendered. My child, be not a lustful one; for lust leadeth the way to
> fornication; neither a filthy talker, nor of lofty eye; for out of all these adulteries are
> engendered. My child, be not an observer of omens, since it leadeth the way to idolatry; neither
> an enchanter, nor an astrologer, nor a purifier, nor be willing to took at these things; for out
> of all these idolatry is engendered. My child, be not a liar, since a lie leadeth the way to
> theft; neither money-loving, nor vainglorious, for out of all these thefts are engendered. My
> child, be not a murmurer, since it leadeth the way to blasphemy; neither self-willed nor
> evil-minded, for out of all these blasphemies are engendered. But be thou meek, since the meek
> shall inherit the earth. Be long-suffering and pitiful and guileless and gentle and good and
> always trembling at the words which thou hast heard. Thou shalt not exalt thyself, nor give
> over-confidence to thy soul. Thy soul shall not be joined with lofty ones, but with just and lowly
> ones shall it have its intercourse. The workings that befall thee receive as good, knowing that
> apart from God nothing cometh to pass.

## Chapter 4: Various Precepts

> My child, him that speaketh to thee the word of God remember night and day; and thou shalt honour
> him as the Lord; for in the place whence lordly rule is uttered, there is the Lord. And thou shalt
> seek out day by day the faces of the saints, in order that thou mayest rest upon their words. Thou
> shalt not long for division, but shalt bring those who contend to peace. Thou shalt judge
> righteously, thou shalt not respect persons in reproving for transgressions. Thou shalt not be
> undecided whether it shall be or no. Be not a stretcher forth of the hands to receive and a drawer
> of them back to give. If thou hast aught, through thy hands thou shalt give ransom for thy sins.
> Thou shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur when thou givest; for thou shalt know who is the good
> repayer of the hire. Thou shalt not turn away from him that is in want, but thou shalt share all
> things with thy brother, and shalt not say that they are thine own; for if ye are partakers in
> that which is immortal, how much more in things which are mortal? Thou shalt not remove thy hand
> from thy son or from thy daughter, but from their youth shalt teach them the fear of God. Thou
> shalt not enjoin aught in thy bitterness upon thy bondman or maidservant, who hope in the same
> God, lest ever they shall fear not God who is over both; for he cometh not to call according to
> the outward appearance, but unto them whom the Spirit hath prepared. And ye bondmen shall be
> subject to your masters as to a type of God, in modesty and fear. Thou shalt hate all hypocrisy
> and everything which is not pleasing to the Lord. Do thou in no wise forsake the commandments of
> the Lord; but thou shalt keep what thou hast received, neither adding thereto nor taking away
> therefrom. In the church thou shalt acknowledge thy transgressions, and thou shalt not come near
> for thy prayer with an evil conscience. This is the way of life. ?
